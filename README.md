A fruit company sells products in packages
Once receipt generated we will deliver items to the customer's address
- banana -> 1 = $1, 3 = $2.5, 6 = $4.5
- apple -> 1 kg = $4, 2kg = $7.5, 10kg = $60

write a shopping cart to order any items and print receipt
`Your total for 10 bananas and 14kg apples are = $83`
